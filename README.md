# Turfgrass2024
A final project on comparing the performance of two random forest classification models classifying turfgrass area in urban LandSat imagery.

Within this sip folder are two subfolders, one ('data') containing the image needed to run this analysis, and two ('scripts') the Jupyter notebook and HTML file of the same notebook describing the analysis. Everything else needed to run this analysis is documented in the Jupyter Notebook.
